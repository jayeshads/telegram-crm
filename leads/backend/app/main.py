# In production, one process serves both the API (above) and the built
# React dashboard (frontend/dist) — "keep one backend" means the frontend
# isn't deployed as its own separate server. Registered last so it never
# shadows an API route (FastAPI/Starlette match routes in registration
# order). Local dev instead runs `npm run dev` (Vite) with its own dev
# server — see frontend/vite.config.ts — so this block is a no-op unless
# FRONTEND_DIST_PATH is set (e.g. in the Docker image).
#
# Deliberately NOT `app.mount("/", StaticFiles(html=True))`: that only
# auto-serves index.html for directory-root requests, not for arbitrary
# client-side routes like /dashboard/campaigns — a hard refresh on any
# React Router sub-page would 404 instead of loading the app. This
# catch-all serves the real file when one exists at that path (JS/CSS/
# favicon/...) and falls back to index.html for everything else, letting
# React Router take over client-side as usual.
