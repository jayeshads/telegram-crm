"""
Postgres storage for the Approval Gate module (see app/db/base.py — this
uses the same shared Postgres database as the rest of the unified app).

GOLDEN RULE (from the product spec): no write-action on a client's ad account
ever executes without a logged human approval. This module is that gate:
- ai_campaign_drafts: strategy + creative + budget, sitting in "pending" until approved
- ai_approvals: an append-only audit log — rows are never updated or deleted
